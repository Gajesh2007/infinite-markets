MEMETIC LICENSE v1.0
Author: Gajesh2007

PREAMBLE
This work was crafted under extreme pressure and is released to fuel more legendary builds. Use it, remix it, meme it—but respect the boundaries below.

1. GRANT OF USE
   You may use, copy, modify, and distribute this work for personal, educational, research, or other non-commercial purposes. All redistributions must keep this license intact and unmodified.

2. MEME PROPAGATION
   When sharing derivatives, carry forward the memes and keep attribution clear. If you make edits, call them out so the lineage stays obvious.

3. ATTRIBUTION
   Every copy or derivative must visibly credit “Gajesh2007” as the original creator. If there is a credits file, README, about page, or splash screen, the attribution must live there.

4. COMMERCIAL GATEKEEPER CLAUSE
   Commercialization, monetization, or any activity that generates revenue directly or indirectly from this work (including but not limited to selling, licensing, bundling into paid offerings, running paid services, tokenizing, or using for advertising) requires prior written approval from Gajesh2007. No approval, no deal. Reach out at your own initiative to secure explicit authorization.

5. RECIPROCITY
   If you evolve this into something better, send a signal back—PR, patch, or note. Hoarding improvements breaks the spirit of the license.

6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
   This work is provided “as is” with no warranties, guarantees, or promises. You accept full responsibility for any fallout.

7. ACCEPTANCE
   Using, copying, modifying, or distributing this work means you accept these terms. If you do not agree, delete all copies and walk away.

Stay sharp, move fast, and build only what matters.
